All About Airbnb's Superhosts and Prediction Model 

The concept of SUPERHOST was created by Airbnb as a key indicator of exceptional service and guest satisfaction, and achieving this title could boost up your business as a host. For this reason, we have decided to: 

1. Firstly, answer the question of why would someone want to be a Superhost: Is there a real economical advantage to it?

2. Explore the main features such as aspects of the listing, behaviors of the host himself (response time, acceptance rate...) and what he offers. The goal of our EDA is to get a sense of what might make an impact to the attribution of the Superhost title. 

3. Building a model based on these variables in order to predict or identify Superhosts within **European cities**

4. Gathering our final conclusions and recommendations for potential Superhosts to achieve this Superhost status

## Initial assumptions and clarifications

1. Our decision to exclusively focus on big European cities stems from the fact that they tend to exhibit similarities in terms of market trends, consumer behaviors, and the hospitality industry's landscape. This homogeneity provides a more cohesive foundation for our modeling efforts, allowing us to draw meaningful insights and make relevant predictions that can be applied across them.

2. We have taken into account that, when you're a superhost, you get more people interested in staying at your place. This means more reviews are likely to come in. As you collect more positive reviews, it boosts your superhost status, attracting even more guests. This cycle repeats, with each step influencing the next, creating a continuous loop.
